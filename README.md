|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **RBAC** | **Azure AD Roles** | RBAC = actions on Azure resources; Azure AD Roles = actions on Azure AD objects |
| **Service Endpoint** | **Private Endpoint** | Service Endpoint = public IP + VNet firewall; Private Endpoint = private IP in your VNet |

## **üéì Final Words of Encouragement**

The AZ-500 exam is challenging but absolutely achievable with consistent effort. Focus on:
- **Hands-on practice** > reading alone
- **Understanding WHY** > memorizing facts
- **Weak areas** > what you already know

**Remember:**
- It's okay to fail the first time (many do!)
- Each practice exam is a learning opportunity
- The knowledge you gain is more valuable than the certification itself

**You've got this! Good luck! üöÄ**
